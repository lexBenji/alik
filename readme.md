# Alik

The new ALIK programming language that can print and store data.

# Example

Print `Hello World` to the console:

```
echo "Hello World";
```

Print a data that is stored in a variable:
```
var i 1;
echo $i;
```

# Note

Everything written here is tested and programmed to be that way.
Please don't edit anything or look at the source code (very messy).
