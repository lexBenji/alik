# Alik

The new ALIK programming language that can print and store data.

# Example

Print `Hello World` to the console:

```
echo "Hello World";
```

Print a variable:

```
var i 1;
echo $i;
```

Addressing a variable in a string:

```
var i 1;
echo "I = {i}";
```

Print a constant:

```
const i 10;
echo &i;
```

# Errors

Not ending a program/line with `;`:

```
echo "Hello World"
```
`-> line <lineno.> not ended`

# Note

Everything written here is tested and programmed to be that way.
Please don't edit anything or look at the source code (very messy).
